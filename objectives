##PROJECT OBJECTIVES

To conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the structure and characteristics of the dataset.

To preprocess the dataset by handling missing values, cleaning inconsistent entries, and encoding categorical variables.

To develop a baseline machine learning model for predicting mental health treatment.

To develop and compare multiple machine learning models to evaluate predictive performance.

To evaluate model performance using appropriate classification metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC).

To apply SHAP explainability techniques to interpret model predictions and identify key influencing factors.

To critically assess ethical considerations and potential bias in the modelling process.
